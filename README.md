`Massively` is a NodeJS app I host on [codemassively.com](https://www.codemassively.com). It's the last in a series of backends I author because `Express` felt bloated.

## About   
I use Massively as a test framework for various things, whether a security feature or browser text editor, it's a lot of things I didn't feel deserved its own repo.
